Cheow Jia Jian
- Course: Bachelor of Information Technology (Honours) in Information Security
- Graduated in 2019
- He said: Those 3 years of education in TAR UMT have opened up many paths for me in my working life. Yes, to be good at what you do comes from your own effort and desire to achieve it. However, what I noticed after I graduated was the exposure, guidance and resources provided to me when I was studying this programme in TAR UMT. This has definitely opened up a world of opportunities for me. The lecturers in our IT department are very resourceful. It was very important to me as I was at first hesitant to study in IT as this field is a niche field in Malaysia. However, with help from my lecturers, it stirred my interest to learn and self-motivate to achieve more, to be better at it. This has helped me to develop a positive attitude towards my studies. TAR UMT has brought me to where I am today and learning experiences I gained during my time there will forever remain with me.

Chai June Rong
- Course: Bachelor of Software Engineering (Honours)
- Graduated in 2019
- He said: After I was shaped into an IT professional from a tech dabbler by the Computer Science programme at TAR UMT, I am able to innovate, communicate and collaborate in ways that enabled me to face any unpredictable yet rewarding challenges in the IT industry. Fundamental skills and knowledge learned in TAR UMT have prepared me to contribute to the open source community that I love while still pursuing my original interests.

I always believe that TAR UMT is more than just an educational institution, there's something unique about its history, culture, neighbourhoods and more importantly the people. When I say people, I mean not just the students, lecturers, staff or management alone but altogether the entire "community" as a whole. Everyone in the community feels connected and I personally think that the existence of such a community is the greatest asset that TAR UMT can have.

Tan Kar Cheng
- Course: Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Management Mathematics with Computing
- Graduated in 2019
- He said: TAR UMT Degree Programme has not only equipped me with the IT/ Mathematics industry related skills but also the problem solving skills which assist me in my current occupation. Attitude is the main key to determine the quality of your degree certificate, not the grades. The certificate can only be your stepping stone and it cannot stop you from seeking goals which are different from what you studied. Make a decision that you will not regret 3 or 4 years later. Your Life, Your Choice!
